Task Description: Make a page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that will allow the user to select a folder. On selecting the folder, the user should be able to see an HTML table with 3 columns:
File name (without its extension)
File size
Button with text “Info” (more details given below)
These columns will represent the appropriate data for each file.

Some constraints to take care of:
The input button should be custom, and its inner text should be “Choose Folder”.
The files should be sorted with respect to their extension in alphabetical order. (this is optional but it may be considered for bonus marks, therefore leading to higher chances of getting shortlisted).
File size for each file should be displayed keeping in mind the following (stackoverflow.com might help in this case):
If a file’s size is greater than 0 bytes and smaller than 1 kB, the unit used should be “bytes”
If a file’s size is greater than or equal to 1 kB and smaller than 1 MB, the unit used should be “kB”
If a file’s size is greater than or equal to 1 MB and smaller than 1 GB, the unit used should be “MB”
If a file’s size is greater than or equal to 1 GB and smaller than 1 TB, the unit used should be “MB”
If a file’s size is greater than or equal to 1 TB the unit used should be “TB”.
On hovering over the “Info” button, the user should see a dialog box/modal/tooltip with the file’s information neatly formatted, such as:
File name
File extension
File size
Other accessible information with respect to the file



Note: The following points will be paid attention to and candidates who follow them will be given preference:
The application should be deployed on a hosting platform/GitHub (free-tier services will do) of your choice.
The application’s UI/UX should be as user friendly and as appealing as possible with appropriate font selection, animations/transitions, table formatting etc.
